## End to End Machine Learing Project For Student Performance Indicator 
# Student Performance Predictor

## Overview
The **Student Performance Predictor** is a web-based application designed to predict student performance based on various factors such as demographics, parental education level, and test scores. The application is implemented using a generic project structure with modular programming to ensure scalability, maintainability, and reusability of the code.

## Features
- **Modular Design**: The application follows a generic project structure, making it easy to manage and extend.
- **Categorical and Numeric Inputs**: Users can input categorical features (e.g., gender, parental education) and numeric features (e.g., test scores).
- **Smooth UI/UX**: A clean and responsive user interface designed with smooth transitions.
- **Prediction Engine**: Backend logic to process input data and predict student performance.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling ensures smooth operation and clear feedback for users.
- **Scalability**: Modular programming allows the addition of new features without disrupting existing functionality.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: SQLite/PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- PostgreSQL (if not using SQLite)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-performance-predictor.git
    cd student-performance-predictor
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up the database:
    - For SQLite:
      No additional configuration is required.

5. Access the application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Optional: Run with Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    docker build -t student-performance-predictor .
    ```

2. Run the Docker container:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5000:5000 student-performance-predictor
    ```

## Usage
1. Navigate to the home page.
2. Input the required categorical and numeric features.
3. Click the **Submit** button to see the predicted performance.
